# Aniceream Website

Welcome to the Anicecream Website project! 
 This website used various web technologies:
 - HTML
 - CSS
- JavaScript

Here is my hosting link: https://pragnyasingh4.github.io/Anicecream/

The ecommerce website is basically Anicecream website. It is generally to facilitate the purchase of the icecream .The page contains contact us, order and gallery which shows various types of icecreams you want to order and a cart is als0 added.Product listings were displayed on the website using HTML templates with CSS for styling and JS for interactivity.

When  a user adds a product to the cart, I updated the cart data structure accordingly,either storing it in the session or in the database associated with the user’s account. I implemented features such as adding/removing items for the cart,updating quantities and calculating total and subtotal of prices. The cart contents were displayed to the user on the website’s frontend,with options to modify the cart as needed. Payment gateway is also there through which you can make payments.
